# Tokens

If you **don't know what are Windows Access Tokens** read this page before continuing:

{% content-ref url="access-tokens.md" %}
[access-tokens.md](access-tokens.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Maybe you could be able to escalate privileges abusing the tokens you already have**

## SeImpersonatePrivilege (3.1.1)

Any process holding this privilege can **impersonate** (but not create) any **token** for which it is able to gethandle. You can get a **privileged token** from a **Windows service** (DCOM) making it perform an **NTLM authentication** against the exploit, then execute a process as **SYSTEM**. Exploit it with [juicy-potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato), [RogueWinRM ](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RogueWinRM)(needs winrm disabled), [SweetPotato](https://github.com/CCob/SweetPotato), [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer).

## SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege (3.1.2)

It is very similar to **SeImpersonatePrivilege**, it will use the **same method** to get a privileged token.\
Then, this privilege allows **to assign a primary token** to a new/suspended process. With the privileged impersonation token you can derivate a primary token (DuplicateTokenEx).\
With the token, you can create a **new process** with 'CreateProcessAsUser' or create a process suspended and **set the token** (in general, you cannot modify the primary token of a running process).

## SeTcbPrivilege (3.1.3)

If you have enabled this token you can use **KERB\_S4U\_LOGON** to get an **impersonation token** for any other user without knowing the credentials, **add an arbitrary group** (admins) to the token, set the **integrity level** of the token to "**medium**", and assign this token to the **current thread** (SetThreadToken).

## SeBackupPrivilege (3.1.4)

This privilege causes the system to **grant all read access** control to any file (only read).\
Use it to **read the password hashes of local Administrator** accounts from the registry and then use "**psexec**" or "**wmicexec**" with the hash (PTH).\
This attack won't work if the Local Administrator is disabled, or if it is configured that a Local Admin isn't admin if he is connected remotely.\
You can **abuse this privilege** with: [https://github.com/Hackplayers/PsCabesha-tools/blob/master/Privesc/Acl-FullControl.ps1](https://github.com/Hackplayers/PsCabesha-tools/blob/master/Privesc/Acl-FullControl.ps1) or with [https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege/tree/master/SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets/bin/Debug](https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege/tree/master/SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets/bin/Debug) or following IppSec in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfCysW0Od8w\&t=2610\&ab\_channel=IppSec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfCysW0Od8w\&t=2610\&ab\_channel=IppSec)

## SeRestorePrivilege (3.1.5)

**Write access** control to any file on the system, regardless of the files ACL.\
You can **modify services**, DLL Hijacking, set **debugger** (Image File Execution Options)‚Ä¶ A lot of options to escalate.

## SeCreateTokenPrivilege (3.1.6)

This token **can be used** as EoP method **only** if the user **can impersonate** tokens (even without SeImpersonatePrivilege).\
In a possible scenario, a user can impersonate the token if it is for the same user and the integrity level is less or equal to the current process integrity level.\
In this case, the user could **create an impersonation token** and add to it a privileged group SID.

## SeLoadDriverPrivilege (3.1.7)

**Load and unload device drivers.**\
You need to create an entry in the registry with values for ImagePath and Type.\
As you don't have access to write to HKLM, you have to **use HKCU**. But HKCU doesn't mean anything for the kernel, the way to guide the kernel here and use the expected path for a driver config is to use the path: "\Registry\User\S-1-5-21-582075628-3447520101-2530640108-1003\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DriverName" (the ID is the **RID** of the current user).\
So, you have to **create all that path inside HKCU and set the ImagePath** (path to the binary that is going to be executed) **and Type** (SERVICE\_KERNEL\_DRIVER 0x00000001).\
[**Learn how to exploit it here.**](../active-directory-methodology/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges.md#seloaddriverprivilege)

## SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege (3.1.8)

This privilege is very similar to **SeRestorePrivilege**.\
It allows a process to ‚Äú**take ownership of an object** without being granted discretionary access‚Äù by granting the WRITE\_OWNER access right.\
First, you have to **take ownership of the registry key** that you are going to write on and **modify the DACL** so you can write on it.

## SeDebugPrivilege (3.1.9)

It allows the holder to **debug another process**, this includes reading and **writing** to that **process' memory.**\
There are a lot of various **memory injection** strategies that can be used with this privilege that evade a majority of AV/HIPS solutions.

# Check privileges

```
whoami /priv
```

The **tokens that appear as **_**Disabled**_** can be enable**, you you actually can abuse _Enabled_ and _Disabled_ tokens.
