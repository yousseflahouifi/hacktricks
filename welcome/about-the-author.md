## Hello!!

This is **Carlos Polop**.

First of all, I want to indicate that **I don't own this entire book**, a lot of **information was copy/pasted from other websites and that content belongs to them** (this is indicated on the pages).

I also wants to say **thanks to all the people that share cyber-security related information for free** on the Internet. Thanks to them I learn new hacking techniques that then I add to Hacktricks.

## BIO

* I've worked in different companies as sysadmin, developer and **pentester**
* I'm a **Telecommunications Engineer** with a **Masters** in **Cybersecurity**
* Relevant certifications: **OSCP, OSWE**, **CRTP, eMAPT, eWPTXv2** and Professional Drone pilot
* I speak **Spanish** and **English** and little of French (some day I will improve that)
* I'm a **CTF player**
* I'm also the developer of [**PEASS-ng**](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng)
* And I really enjoy researching, playing CTFs, pentesting and everything related to **hacking**
