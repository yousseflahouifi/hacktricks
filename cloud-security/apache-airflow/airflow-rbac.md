# RBAC

Airflow ships with a **set of roles by default**: **Admin**, **User**, **Op**, **Viewer**, and **Public**. **Only `Admin`** users could **configure/alter the permissions for other roles**. But it is not recommended that `Admin` users alter these default roles in any way by removing or adding permissions to these roles.

* **`Admin`** users have all possible permissions.
* **`Public`** users (anonymous) don‚Äôt have any permissions.
* **`Viewer`** users have limited viewer permissions (only read). It **cannot see the config.**
* **`User`** users have `Viewer` permissions plus additional user permissions that allows him to manage DAGs a bit. He **can see the config file**
* **`Op`** users have `User` permissions plus additional op permissions.

Note that **admin** users can **create more roles** with more **granular permissions**.

Also note that the only default role with **permission to list users and roles is Admin, not even Op** is going to be able to do that.

## Default Permissions

These are the default permissions per default role:

* **Admin**
