# Cloud Functions <a href="reviewing-cloud-functions" id="reviewing-cloud-functions"></a>

Google [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) allow you to host code that is executed when an event is triggered, without the requirement to manage a host operating system. These functions can also store environment variables to be used by the code.

```bash
# List functions
gcloud functions list

# Get function config including env variables
gcloud functions describe [FUNCTION NAME]

# Get logs of previous runs
# By default, limits to 10 lines
gcloud functions logs read [FUNCTION NAME] --limit [NUMBER]
```

## Enumerate Open Cloud Functions

With the following code [taken from here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/gl-redteam/gcp\_misc/-/blob/master/find\_open\_functions.sh) you can find Cloud Functions that permit unauthenticated invocations.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

############################
# Run this tool to find Cloud Functions that permit unauthenticated invocations
# anywhere in your GCP organization.
# Enjoy!
############################

for proj in $(gcloud projects list --format="get(projectId)"); do
    echo "[*] scraping project $proj"

    enabled=$(gcloud services list --project "$proj" | grep "Cloud Functions API")

    if [ -z "$enabled" ]; then
	continue
    fi


    for func_region in $(gcloud functions list --quiet --project "$proj" --format="value[separator=','](NAME,REGION)"); do
        # drop substring from first occurence of "," to end of string.
        func="${func_region%%,*}"
        # drop substring from start of string up to last occurence of ","
        region="${func_region##*,}"
        ACL="$(gcloud functions get-iam-policy "$func" --project "$proj" --region "$region")"

        all_users="$(echo "$ACL" | grep allUsers)"
        all_auth="$(echo "$ACL" | grep allAuthenticatedUsers)"

        if [ -z "$all_users" ]
        then
              :
        else
              echo "[!] Open to all users: $proj: $func"
        fi

        if [ -z "$all_auth" ]
        then
              :
        else
              echo "[!] Open to all authenticated users: $proj: $func"
        fi
    done
done

```

# App Engine Configurations <a href="reviewing-app-engine-configurations" id="reviewing-app-engine-configurations"></a>

Google [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) is another ["serverless"](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/serverless/) offering for hosting applications, with a focus on scalability. As with Cloud Functions, **there is a chance that the application will rely on secrets that are accessed at run-time via environment variables**. These variables are stored in an `app.yaml` file which can be accessed as follows:

```bash
# First, get a list of all available versions of all services
gcloud app versions list

# Then, get the specific details on a given app
gcloud app describe [APP]
```

# Cloud Run Configurations <a href="reviewing-cloud-run-configurations" id="reviewing-cloud-run-configurations"></a>

Google [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is another serverless offer where you can search for env variables also. Cloud Run creates a small web server, running on port 8080, that sits around waiting for an HTTP GET request. When the request is received, a job is executed and the job log is output via an HTTP response.

The access to this web server might be public of managed via IAM permissions:

```bash
# First get a list of services across the available platforms
gcloud run services list --platform=managed
gcloud run services list --platform=gke

# To learn more, export as JSON and investigate what the services do
gcloud run services list --platform=managed --format=json
gcloud run services list --platform=gke --format=json

# Attempt to trigger a job unauthenticated
curl [URL]

# Attempt to trigger a job with your current gcloud authorization
curl -H \
    "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
    [URL]
```

## Enumerate Open CloudRun

With the following code [taken from here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/gl-redteam/gcp\_misc/-/blob/master/find\_open\_cloudrun.sh) you can find Cloud Run services that permit unauthenticated invocations.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

############################
# Run this tool to find Cloud Run services that permit unauthenticated
# invocations anywhere in your GCP organization.
# Enjoy!
############################

for proj in $(gcloud projects list --format="get(projectId)"); do
    echo "[*] scraping project $proj"

    enabled=$(gcloud services list --project "$proj" | grep "Cloud Run API")

    if [ -z "$enabled" ]; then
	continue
    fi


    for run in $(gcloud run services list --platform managed --quiet --project $proj --format="get(name)"); do
        ACL="$(gcloud run services get-iam-policy $run --platform managed --project $proj)"

        all_users="$(echo $ACL | grep allUsers)"
        all_auth="$(echo $ACL | grep allAuthenticatedUsers)"

        if [ -z "$all_users" ]
        then
              :
        else
              echo "[!] Open to all users: $proj: $run"
        fi

        if [ -z "$all_auth" ]
        then
              :
        else
              echo "[!] Open to all authenticated users: $proj: $run"
        fi
    done
done

```
